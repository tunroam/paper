## Resources

All required hardware for testing is provided by the student.
The supervisor will allocate time for supervising this thesis.

The AP (access point) for this research will be
one or more SoC
(System on Chip: e.g. `[`Banana`|`Orange`|`Raspberry`]` Pi)
which will run Linux server or OpenWrt.

The student has a SoC connected to his home router via wire,
allowing remote configuration of the test setup.
The advertised wireless configuration can be tested/observed
through a second SoC connected to the router.
This second SoC is reachable externally by using the first SoC as a jump server.
