### Week 02: Design

We start with a literature study:

- Which authentication protocols are supported on COTS clients? (e.g. EAP)
- Which authentication server should we use for testing and how can we add functionality?
- Which VPN protocol(s) are supported on COTS clients?
- Which additional network traffic is needed? (e.g. DNS, ARP)
- How can these network policies be managed?

Then we will design:

- How will the test setup look like?
- Detailed drawing of setup
- Sequence diagrams
