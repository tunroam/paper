### Week 03: Test setup

In this week we will create the proposed test setup.

1. install and setup all components
2. create mocks for intended functionalities (i.e. initially the testing if a VPN server is listening on an endpoint will always `return true`)
3. replace mocks by functionality, only supporting the happy flow

The expected components include:

- Authentication server
- Authentication client (i.e. AP)

Expected functionalities:

- Verify if VPN server listens on endpoint
- Set network policies
- Filter DNS requests

<!--
stages:
setup of all components
develop mvp of authentication
develop mvp of VPN check
develop mvp of dns network filter
develop mvp
