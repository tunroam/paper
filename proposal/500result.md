# Expected results

The goal of this research is to develop a protocol.
We proof this protocol with
a Proof of Concept (PoC).

<!--
Through this research we explore the feasibility of this setup.

Clients using this system will have enhanced security through using a VPN,
even when using an alternative WiFi AP not part of this research.

Providers of APs decrease their liability for potential
unlawful content (accessing censored materials, copyright infringement).
