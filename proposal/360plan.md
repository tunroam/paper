## Planning

This thesis will take part over a 4 week period
as stated by the [SNE Master Research Projects Process](https://rp.delaat.net/process.html).
The first week was used to create this proposal.
The topics for week 2-4 are stated below.
We estimate to spend 4h/day on research,
2h on writing of the report
and 2h for overhead/buffer.
In the 5th week we expect to present our findings at the University of Amsterdam.
The feedback received during the presentation will be used to update our report,
which will be submitted in the 6th week.

<!--

We defined items
(tasks/user stories/functionalities/research topics)
in section ([Scope]) and refer to them in this section.




| step | title | description |
| --- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 0.0.1 | dependencies |
| | Port nr. VPN | Research possibilities of communicating the port number of the VPN. The port number needs to be know on the end device. But how does the AP know which port to whitelist? DNS, in RADIUS info, etc.? |
| | DNS for DHCP | When the IP of the VPN endpoint changes, how does the endpoint propagate its new public IP address? |
| | |
| | EAP protocols | Which EAPs are supported by Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)? |
| | |
| 0.1.0 | proposal | share proposal with stakeholders |
| | Cert. in DNS | Can we store the VPN certificate in DNS? |
| | Cert. from DNS | Can we retrieve the certificate from DNS? |
| | Cert. via DoH | Can we retrieve the certificate in a browser using DNS over HTTPS (DoH)? |
| | future work | |
| | Signal IP update | What is an efficient way for the AP to know that its public IP has been changed? |


At the end of the second week,
we ought to have a minimal prototype running,
without DNS and DNS filtering, using an IP address.

At the end of the third week,
we ought to have the VPN be reachable using an DNS A record
and have DNS filtering in place.
We also look into ways of configuring the client
and ways the client can obtain the VPN certificate.

TODO this seems all like scrum, not research, make it into actionable research questions.

found of closed router is a result!
