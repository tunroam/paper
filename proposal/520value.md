## Value proposition

The
[network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect)
(as used in economics)
of this proposition is applicable to the AP density,
increasing the availability of free Wi-Fi.

Even with a single setup
(home router with VPN),
the users who have access to its VPN will have added value,
since the VPN is always on,
on any Wi-Fi connection.


### Intended user

Value:

- access to more free Wi-Fi APs
- additional security through VPN

costs:

- additional complexity/configuration
- latency (costs of using a VPN)
- bandwidth loss due to sharing and VPN usage

<!--
When current bandwidth of an AP is not increased,
the internet speed will be reduced when multiple clients connect.
However,
when one already had a paid VPN provider and can terminate this contract,
these costs may cancel each other out.
-->

### Existing free Wi-Fi provider

Existing free Wi-Fi facilitators may join.
The use of VPN will render them unable to filter specific traffic or log
metadata such as DNS queries of its connected devices.
This could reduce the complexity of their system
and prevent liability issues.

An existing provider of Wi-Fi services could broadcast
a second SSID and implemented the suggested protocol (this research)
on a separate network segment.
