For my RP2 I propose a topic, for which Surfnet is able to supervise me.
We agreed that I could start mid Oct. and will be present at their office.
Could someone of rp@os3.nl review my topic suggestion?
I wrote it similar to the format found on rp.delaat.net

<h4>Incentivize distributed shared WiFi through VPN on home routers</h4>

Many forms of free WiFi exists such as
ad based solutions [1],
provider initiatives [2],
hotel/restaurant/etc. hotspots and
Open Wireless Movement [3].
Security and privacy are important factors for sharing wireless.
The provider does not want to be held liable [4]
and the client wants privacy.

<br/><br/>

The RP will consist of creating a protocol + Proof of Concept
to securely join WiFi networks and share your network.
A client connects to a wireless AP using RADIUS credentials; username = PORT@domain,
which indicates to which VPN the client will connect to.
The AP (upgraded home WiFi router) only lets clients connect to VPN servers,
which run on the client's home router,
creating a tunnel between a device (client) and the owner's home router (VPN endpoint).

<br/><br/>

The client has the VPN location embedded in his 802.1x credentials
for the shared SSID (like Eduroam) for participating APs.
Additionally, the client has a VPN client installed,
enabling APs to only allow (whitelist) VPN traffic
and a DNS req. for VPN endpoint discovery.
This creates the safety for joining any wireless (using the VPN)
and sharing your wireless (whitelisting VPN traffic)
without worry for liability issues.

<br/><br/>

This setup will incentivize users to upgrade their routers,
giving them more security when connecting to any foreign wireless (through VPN)
and provides access to wireless in more places (which require VPN to connect).

<br/><br/>

This topic is suggested by the student,
who can be asked for further explanation/sequence diagram (which will also be in the proposal).
