Subject: MSc. thesis (4w) supervisor

Hi,

This is an unusual request; I'm looking for a thesis supervisor for my master Security and Network Engineering.
(at which Jaap van Ginkel is a lecturer)

For my thesis I'd like to create a open source Eduroam kind of network,
not for educational purpose, but APs at home locations.
The idea is described in the attached document.

Since I've passed all courses of my study, I can start my thesis at any moment, preferably in a couple of weeks.
I do need to make arrangements with my current employer (Rabobank) to take the time off to do this thesis
and discuss it with the my professor.

Some requirements from UvA:
- spend 4 consecutive weeks full-time on the project
- present at their location or, if that is not possible, here at our SNE/UvA site
(source: https://rp.delaat.net/process.html)

If there is an opportunity, I would love to introduce myself in person at your office.
My resume can be found here: https://lentink.consulting/#resume

Yours sincerely,
Sander Lentink
