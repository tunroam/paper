To communicate the intention of the project,
we ought to have a SSID which conveys:
- that the AP provides free wifi
- you need a VPN
- people can participate (i.e. 'open')
- more than one AP in system (i.e. 'roaming')
- points to an url (e.g. thenameofproject.org as SSID)
- maybe version number? 'nameofproject.org 19' in which 19 stands for version 2019

wifi in name does not make any sense,
it is a Wi-Fi SSID!

Many open networks have Free WiFi in their name,
wifi is useless, since its an wifi ssid,
free might be a useful indicator.
