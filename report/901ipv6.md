## IPv6

We assume that every VPN endpoint has either one public IPv4 address
(or access to it through port forwarding)
or a dual stack from which the endpoint has at least one public IPv6 address
and access to IPv4, either direct or through NAT.


```
           AP                VPN server
case 1____________            ________
     |IPv4        |          |IPv4    |
     |            |---IPv4-->|        |
     |____________|          |________|
    
case 2____________            ________
     |NAT IPv4    |          |IPv4    |
     |IPv6        |---IPv4-->|        |
     |____________|          |________|
    
case 3____________            ________
     |NAT IPv4    |          |NAT IPv4|
     |IPv6        |---IPv6-->|IPv6    |
     |____________|          |________|
    
case 4____________            ________
     |IPv4        |          |NAT IPv4|
     |IPv4 to IPv6|---IPv6-->|IPv6    |
     |____________|          |________|

```

The first three cases are feasible.
Case 4 requires
[translation](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/6to4-why-is-it-so-bad)
between v4 and v6.
<!--
For the scope of this research, we will use port forwarding
from a provider router.
-->

We expect that with port forwarding,
not having the IP on the NIC, case 4 is not possible.
We consider this to be future work.

### TODO

https://superuser.com/questions/1259994/can-i-reach-my-ipv6-website-via-ipv4

What I want:
to listen on the IPv4 interface and be able to get IPv6,
this will be a killer feature,
but...
has nothing to do with this protocol,
only the interoperability for interconnecting.
