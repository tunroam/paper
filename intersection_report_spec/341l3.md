#### L3 Internet layer

IP packets from the client MAY
be limited to network/connection management
(e.g. DNS lookup for VPN endpoint)
and the VPN endpoint.

The AP MAY
have one segregated network (e.g. VLAN) for all clients connecting to the AP,
allowing L3 filtering.

The 802.1x authentication is needed to provide the AP with the domain or IP
to which it will allow the client to connect.
The AP SHOULD
only route packets from the client to the VPN IP address.
