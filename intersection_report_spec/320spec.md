## Protocol: AP Specification

In the previous section (*[Protocol: Supplicant / client]*)
we read what the supplicant communicates to the AP,
we now look into how
&mdash; the authentication server used by &mdash;
the AP handles authentication requests.

We start by defining/parsing the *[802.1x identity]* received by the supplicant,
followed by the *[802.1x authentication server]* that receives this data.
This section concludes with *[Network policies]* the AP
SHOULD
implement.

A VPN server SHOULD be installed on an AP when configured for a home location.
However,
configuration and VPN identity management is not part of this protocol.

The goal of this protocol is to allow the AP to share Wi-Fi
without the the facilitator being liable for the traffic generated by clients.
We do this by only allowing VPN traffic
(and *[DNS]* to locate VPN server)
to be seen by the ISP of the AP.
<!--
On the local network,
additional traffic is needed
for network management (e.g. DHCP).
