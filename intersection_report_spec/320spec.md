## Protocol: AP Specification

In the previous section (*[Protocol: Supplicant]*)
we read what the supplicant communicates to the AP.
We will now look at the authentication server the AP
uses to process authentication requests.
<!--
we now look into how
&mdash; the authentication server used by &mdash;
the AP handles authentication requests.
-->

We start by defining/parsing the *[802.1x identity]* received by the supplicant,
followed by the *[802.1x authentication server]* that receives this data.
This section concludes with *[Network policies]* the AP
SHOULD
implement.

A VPN server SHOULD be installed on an AP when configured for a home location.
However,
configuration and VPN identity management is not part of this protocol.

The goal of this protocol is to allow an AP to share Wi-Fi
without the facilitator being liable for the traffic generated by clients.
We do this by only allowing VPN traffic
and *[DNS]* to locate the VPN server
to be seen by the ISP of that AP.
The client will appear on the internet with
the IP address of its VPN server.
<!--
its own home address.

On the local network,
additional traffic is needed
for network management (e.g. DHCP).
