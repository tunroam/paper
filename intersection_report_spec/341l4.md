#### L4 Transport layer

The AP
SHOULD
filter based on the correct IP protocol and port.
<!--
(if the AP filters or provides free internet is up to the operator,
at least de VPN should be reachable, if its open access, that's also fine)
-->


To enable the client to use multiple *[VPN protocols]*,
the requirements in
+@tbl:ipprotos 
are given.

| [IP protocol](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) | ID | RFC | NAT | public IP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transmission Control (TCP) | 0x06 | [793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) | SHOULD | [SHOULD](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) |
| User Datagram (UDP) | 0x11 | [768](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768) | MUST | [MUST](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) |
| Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) | 0x2F | [2784](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2784) | MAY | [MAY](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) |
| Encap Security Payload (ESP) | 0x32 | [4303](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4303) | MAY | MUST |
| Authentication Header (AH) | 0x33 | [4302](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4302) | MAY | MUST |
Table: IP protocols {#tbl:ipprotos}

NAT refers to
Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)
([RFC2663](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2663))
and public IP when every client is given a public IP address.

When clients are provided with a public IP address,
incoming traffic should also be filtered.


The AP MAY
filter well-known ports (below 1024),
except for
22 (socks tunnel),
443 (HTTPS tunnel)
and
500 (IKE for IPsec),
but
MUST
allow ports
(for supported IP protocols)
over 1024 when given in the identity.

##### Motivation

Only UDP is considered a MUST have,
since OpenVPN, WireGuard and IPsec/IKE,
see section *[VPN protocols]*.

An AP operator
MAY
want to block ports associated with email
or other well-known ports.
<!--
and filter DNS queries which do not include the
required subdomain (as described in section *[Hostname]*).
-->

We need UDP 500 for Internet Key Exchange (IKE),
which switches to UDP 4500 for NAT Traversal as defined in
[RFC 3947 section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3947).
<!--
IPsec
(UDP ([protocol ID 17](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml))
will carry
[protocol ID 50 (ESP) and ID 51 (AH)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml),
which in turn may carry L2TP (thus we do not need UDP 1701)).

If no NAT is detected, it will not use UDP 4500 but just ESP and AH.
-->

<!--

sources are inconclusive about port 1701.
Is it embedded in IPsec, thus L2TP port is not needed
or is it needed for the initial setup?

-->

If the AP provides public IP addresses to supplicants,
it needs to support IP protocol 0x32 ESP
and
0x33 AH.
IPsec does a check for NAT, when no NAT is detected it will use ESP and AH instead of NAT Traversal.

Some ISPs block certain ports
[@blockports],
therefore we allow
clients
to pick custom ports,
matching their VPN endpoint.
