# Method

This section provides a *[Protocol introduction]*
by showing an example sequence diagram.
Next we start the protocol definition by looking at
the requirements for a supplicant
(section *[Protocol: Supplicant]*)
&mdash; the one initiating the protocol &mdash;
followed by the specification for the AP
(section *[Protocol: AP Specification]*).
We conclude by describing the
*[Test setup]*.
