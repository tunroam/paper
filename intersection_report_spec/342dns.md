#### DNS

VPN clients
MAY
require DNS to lookup their VPN endpoint,
therefore the AP
MUST
support Do53
(as defined by [draft-hoffman-dns-terminology-ter-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-dns-terminology-ter-01)).
The subdomain requirement in section *[Hostname]*
enables the AP to filter DNS queries which do not include the specified subdomain.

We see the adoption of encrypted DNS in web browsers [@ncscdns]
and the Android operating system supports[^dotandroid]
[RFC7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
DoT.
The AP
MAY
allow encrypted DNS for DoT using port 853
or DoH using a whitelist of trusted providers[^dohproviders].
<!--

-->
This results in the DNS query originating from the AP
instead of the VPN server,
without intermediates (ISP)
being able to log the DNS queries.

<!--
However, one may propose to run a DNS resolver on the AP,
which works like a proxy,
connecting to encrypted DNS service.
This requires the AP to push this local DNS resolver
in the DHCP.

This setup is not explored in this research since it has two downsides;
1) the DNS query originates from the AP instead of the VPN server,
which is debatable,
2) the client needs to accept the DNS provided in the DHCP
(which may require admin rights on the local device).
-->

If the AP provider does not want its ISP to see any DNS queries
from connecting clients,
it
MAY
hijack Do53 DNS traffic like ISPs do
[@ripednshijack],
since clients
MAY NOT
accept the DNS server from DHCP.
This allows the AP to tunnel the requests using a DoH proxy,
which are provided by parties such as
Cloudflare[^cloudflared]
and
Facebook[^facebookdoh].

##### Motivation

The ability to filter DNS gives the AP provider more safety
in countries where this might be desired[^cyberdiss].

The client
MAY NOT
accept the nameserver pushed by an AP,
which is motivated by:

- When users cannot use a custom DNS, they have less privacy when VPN is off.
- Users may not know how to enable automatic nameserver configuration through DHCP.
- Windows requires admin rights to change this. <!-- verified on win10 -->
