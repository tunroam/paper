## Protocol: Supplicant / client

The motivation for the settings of the client can be found in *[Protocol: AP Specification]*.
The client needs to configure two aspects,
the 802.1x *[Wireless configuration]*
and a VPN client.

The following information is required:

- domain or IP of *[VPN server]*
- IP *[Protocols and ports]* used to connect to *[VPN server]*
- will the supplicant validate the 802.1x certificate?
