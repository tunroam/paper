#### L2 Link layer

The protocols used on the link layer are up to the implementer of this protocol.
Expected protocols are
ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
and ARP
(Address Resolution Protocol, [RFC826](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc826.txt))
for IPv4.
The AP
MAY
limit ARP to prevent MAC learning of other devices connected to the network
and detect MAC spoofing.

We note that L3 filtering by a router is bypassed when an attacker
knows the MAC address of a device connected on the link layer.
Therefore one
MAY
keep a whitelist of MAC addresses the supplicant is allowed to connect to
or provide other ways of separation (e.g. VLAN).

Suggestions on filtering frames can be found on
kernel.org[^kernelonwlan].

##### Motivation


The implementer is responsible for any security related issues with providing a client
with access to the private network.
This might expose devices 'protected' by NAT such as Network Attached Storage devices.


<!--
Larger networks have a VLAN per supplicant.
We could have a separate VLAN.
