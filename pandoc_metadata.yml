  It is infeasible for most consumers to safely share their internet connection through an open Wi-Fi.
  This research explores the possibility of 
  dynamically whitelisting VPN endpoints
  on Wi-Fi networks by providing a client's VPN endpoint details
  in the 802.1x identity.
  This reduces the liability concerns of Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) providers
  and forces clients accessing these APs to use a VPN,
  which will increase their privacy.
  We modified a RADIUS server to implement our proposed protocol
  and verified it through a Proof of Concept (PoC).
