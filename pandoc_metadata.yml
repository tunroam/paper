  TODO this is not the final version END NOTE
  We found that it is possible to dynamically whitelist VPN endpoints
  on Wi-Fi networks by providing the VPN endpoint details
  in the 802.1x identity.
  This reduces the libility concerns of Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) providers
  and forces clients accessing these APs to use a VPN,
  which in turn increases their privacy.
  We modified a RADIUS server to implement this proposed protocol
  and verified it through a Proof of Concept (PoC).
